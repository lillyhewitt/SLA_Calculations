## How to Use 
1. Download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Download Git from https://www.git-scm.com/downloads
3. Download Java from https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ (oracle.com is my recommendation)

6. In the Clone Git Repository dialog that appears, enter the URI of the repository (found clicking <Code> within repo).
7. Click Next to select the branches you want to clone, and then click Next again to set the local destination for the repository (want to clone main branch).
8. Click Finish to start the cloning process.
